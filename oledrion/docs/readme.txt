etc


Administration
----------------------
1/ you can export your clients file to a csv file
2/ you can manage languages, VAT, categories, vendors and manufacturers, product, orders, discounts and newsletter
3/ you have 7 blocks (every block of the module can be duplicated as much as you want) :

- Categories
- Recent products
- Top products
- Best Sales
- Best Rated products
- Random product
- Products in promotion

The category block is very "original" because you can use it in two ways :

a) In a classical way, in this case the module will list all the module's categories
b) In a more modern way, the module is working with the categories page.

That is to say that if you are looking a category in the categories page, then the block of categories will list the sub categories of the current category. The page and the block are "talking".

4/ Notification when a product is sold

Suggestions from Ross B.:
- Add admin hints when required config such as Packing, location, Delivery are missing which is confusing to users (no way to select, empty radio buttons)
- SMS order notification incomplete. Currently sent before payment verification. Completely rework to add transaction ID (from gateway / paypal) and send after payment verification
- Cannot select more than one gateway (#1). See "TODO" in gateway.php.
- Bug(s) No images can be loaded, all configuration pages. Xoops version?
- fix bug with selecting Picture for payment (admin). May be the wrong place to select picture, since it is used to represent gateway and should be a gateway property (ie; paypal image).
- change templates (checkout) for "Select delivery method form" and "Select payment method form" so that radio button fields are one line each.
- Add stub update DB (at payment verification) function which calls script sh/php for update other DB (such as licensing, access priveleges). Consider making gateway or payment config property.
- Fix receipt email templates such that header and columns line up. Perhaps pretty html option?
- Document this module (not me)
